### Introduction

This stackable interface board for the Broadcom development platform also known as the Raspberry Pi is of a hand solderable 
design meant to be compatible with the devices in the Humber Parts Crib which require more skills and techniques to assemble.
It has a bidirectional LED and three I2C device sockets. The bidirectional LED allows the hardware equivalent of "Hello World"
to be achieved by blinking the LED. I2C is a very common hardware peripheral bus and is designed to have an analog breakout
board, a Real Time Clock module, and an integrated environmental sensor module connected. It takes most individuals about a
week of effort to complete these build instructions directed towards technologically inclined students especially given other
commitments. Be aware that the image creation steps take at least 3 hours alone.

### Student Sense Hat Specifications

NOTE: This mostly through hole design is pin compatible with original mostly surface mount sense hat design which is on the devices in the Humber Parts Crib. The Fall 2017 design is in [Fritzing](https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/blob/master/electronics/StudentSenseHatV06.fzz) while the Fall 2016 design was in [Eagle](https://github.com/vladporcila/ModularSenseHatStripped), if curious, take a look at using the [Sparkfun Cam file](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-eagle-board-layout/generating-gerbers). Once you have recieved your PCB the kit looks something like the following photo.

### Student Sense Hat Assembly

1. Please get started by ensuring that you have reviewed the [six 15 second soldering videos](https://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/telescope/soldering.htm) and can comment on them. (If you are into materials, look up tin pest and tin whiskers.)
2. Work through as much of this set of instructions as possible. (Feel free to drop through the Humber College Institute of Technology & Advanced Learning North Campus Prototype Lab in J233 for additional guidance both before and after class.)
![Prototype Lab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/IMG_20170616_184112490_HDR.jpg)
3. For additional soldering guidance such as surface mount and desoldering:
	1. Watch some [YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfXXRfRIzY&list=PLQ32vZrF5U2lFOJTtZDytBWBYVLNp4RYz).
	2. Be sure to wear safety glasses and consult an expert regarding safety, you can even start at your [local hackerspace](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/List_of_Hackerspaces) (Ideally working towards IPC J-STD-001 Requirements for Soldered Electrical and Electronic Assemblies).
4. Please remember your eyewear (safety glasses if you don't regularly wear glasses) and select a seat in J232.
![Image of lab station](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/MicroRover/master/images/1.1j232station.jpg) 
5. Turn on the computer under the desk on the left side.
6. Note the red power switch to the back right side of the workstation that controls the power to the monitor, overhead light, and test equipment.
7. Also note the under desk grounding strap jack for wrist straps - Electronics (ELIC) students must buy the $4.99 wrist straps while both CENG and ELIC students are to have the $4.99 safety glasses.
8. When soldering move the extraction arm flow control towards the straight through symbol as it is in the photo below.
9. The sponge in the soldering station can be moistened at the sink in J233. 
1. Start with components kit:  
![Image of Prototype](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/componentskit.jpg)
1. Optional: try out your kit on your breadboard.
![Image of Prototype](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/bbphoto.jpg)
2. Create schematic.
3. Create board add photos of equipment and guide from 555 timer/prototype lab bb/plab I drive.
4. At this stage you should have:
![Image of Prototype](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/componentsandpcb.jpg)
5. Decide whether you will be attempting the optional surface mount resistor.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/05.jpg)
6. Or whether you will be going with the through hole resistor.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/02.jpg)
6. Place resistors in corresponding locations:
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/06.jpg)
7. Bend the leads to hold them in place.  
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/07.jpg)
8. Solder the resistors from the bottom.  
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/08.jpg)  
9. Add flux if having trouble but, do not depress the end of the flux pen, just touching it is enough.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/09.jpg)
10. Solder the resistors from the top.  
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/10.jpg)
11. Trim and keep excess leads (hold onto them while cutting to not allow them to become projectiles).
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/11.jpg)
7. Place via wires (can be stripped solid core wire or just leftover cut off resistor/LED leads) in corresponding locations:
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/12.jpg)
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/13.jpg)
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/14.jpg)
15. Solder vias.

16. Trim the excess via leads.  
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/16.jpg)
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/17.jpg)
18. Place MOSFETS and LED (N.B. the LED's longer leg is the same as on a red LED. Thus, when oriented the same way as the fritzing diagrams the red/green will be the opposite of those in the parts crib. Which way you put it is in your hands.)
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/18.jpg)
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/19.jpg)
20. Solder one pin of each MOSFET only from bottom side, semiconductor devices are heat sensitive.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/20.jpg)
21. Solder another pin of each MOSFET only from bottom side.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/21.jpg)
22. Solder the third  pin of each MOSFET only from bottom side.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/22.jpg)
23. Trim the MOSFET leads and make sure that none of them have solder bridges. (Note that the LED has shifted agianst the PCB here.)  
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/23.jpg)
24. Make sure the LED is away from the PCB.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/24.jpg)

26. Trim the excess LED leads and use for any remaining vias.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/26.jpg)
27. Place sockets.  
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/27.jpg)
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/28.jpg)
28. Solder sockets, no lead trimming is necessary.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/29.jpg)
30. If you soldered the through hole 1kΩ resistor into place then skip past the surface mount resistor steps. Else, if you did not solder the through hole 1kΩ resistor then remove surface mount resistor from its packaging.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/04.jpg)
31. Note that the packaging may look empty from the back.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/03.jpg)
32. Place a little bit of solder onto each of the pads, in this photo there is probably a little bit too much.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/31.jpg)
33. Hold the suface mount resistor with tweezers and heat one end of the resistor with the soldering iron.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/33.jpg)
34. It should now look something like this.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/34.jpg)
35. Heat the other end of the resistor with the soldering iron so that it looks like the next photo.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/35.jpg)
36. Continue to alternate reheating the ends to make it flush with the board.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/36.jpg)
37. While considering surface mount resitors, be aware that the RTC module can charge the CR2032 battery causing damage.
    To permanently disable the charging circuit, please remove the 200 ohm surface mount resistor (board on left) near the unused I2C header by pushing it off the PCB (board on right) with a hot soldering iron.
![Prototype Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/master/images/32.jpg)

### Student Raspberry Pi Image Creation and Test Code

1.	Building the Humber image for the Sense Hat: [https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/blob/master/cribpisdcard.md](https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/blob/master/cribpisdcard.md)  
	Note that apt-get puts the installed packages into
    /var/cache/apt/archives/ so a zip of the files from there would
    complement the script used by these instructions.

5.  Open a terminal and type:
	```
	git clone https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat.git
	cd StudentSenseHat/firmware
	gcc -Wall -o traffic2B traffic2B.c -lwiringPi
	sudo ./traffic2B
	```
	write to your blog what happens with your LED.
	
6.	From the Start Menu->Preferences->Raspberry Pi Configuration->Interfaces set I2C to Enabled.

7.	Return to your terminal and type:
    ```Shell
	make
	sudo ./ghmain
	```
	write to your blog what happens.

8.	You can read the OS date with:
    ```Shell
	date
	```
	You can set the OS date with:
	```Shell
	sudo date –s “29 AUG 1997 13:00:00”
	```
	You can write the OS date to the RTC with:
	```Shell
	sudo hwclock –w
	```
	You can read the RTC date with:
	```Shell
	sudo hwclock -r
	```
	
9.	Things to consider for your particular application: boot options (Gui to terminal), and permissions when auto mounting usb keys.
	
10.  Use <http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/> to read the image
    into a file.

### Enterprise Wi-Fi

Connecting to Enterprise Wi-Fi can be a challenge but the graphical desktop has come a long way from where it was, please share your respective successes in situations where the GUIs do not work - here is my configuration:

1.  In /etc/network/interfaces:
	```
	auto lo
	iface lo inet loopback
	iface eth0 inet dhcp
	allow-hotplug wlan0
	iface wlan0 inet manual
	wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
	iface default inet dhcp
	```

2.  In /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf:
	```
	ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
	update_config=1
	network={
        ssid="myWi-Fi@Humber"
        proto=RSN
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        pairwise=CCMP
        auth_alg=OPEN
        eap=PEAP
        identity="n12345678"
        password="aaaAAA12"
        phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
	}
	```

	I have been told that more recently the Prototype Lab staff have said to use:
	```
	sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
	```

	Add the follow to file and fill in identity and password field save and restart RPI:
	```
	network={
	ssid="myWi-Fi@Humber"
	priority=999
	proto=RSN
	key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
	pairwise=CCMP
	auth_alg=OPEN
	eap=PEAP
	identity="STUDENT ID"
	password="PASSWORD"
	phase1="peaplabel=0"
	phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
	}
	```
	Even more recently the Prototype Lab staff have successfully tested the 
	following sample configuration file. The configuration includes sections 
	for Humber’s myWi-fi, Eduroam, home WPA encrypted networks, and open networks like “Welcome To Humber”.:
	```
	# Sample configuration file for Raspberry Pi to connect to various WiFi networks.
	# /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

	ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
	update_config=1
	country=CA

	# sample network configuration for Humber College myWi-Fi
	# change text in <> to your account values (remove the < and > while doing this )
	network={
		ssid="myWi-Fi@Humber"
		key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
		auth_alg=OPEN
		eap=PEAP
		identity="<YourHCNetID>"
		password="<YourHCnetPassword>"
		phase1="peaplabel=0"
		phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
		priority=999
		proactive_key_caching=1
	}

	# Sample network configuration for joining Eduroam Wi-Fi network
	# change text in <> to your account values (remove the < and > while doing this )
	network={
		ssid="eduroam"
		scan_ssid=1
		key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
		eap=PEAP
		identity="<YourHCnetID>@humber.ca"
		password="<YourHCnetPassword>"
		phase1="peaplabel=0"
		phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
		proactive_key_caching=1

	}

	# Sample network configuration for joining a home wi-fi network.
	# change text in <> to your network values (remove the < and > while doing this )
	network={
		ssid="<yourNetworkSSID"
		psk="<yourNetworkPassword>"
		proto=RSN
		key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
		pairwise=CCMP
		auth_alg=OPEN
	}

	#Sample networtk configuration for joining open, unsecured network
	network={
		ssid="<yourNetworkSSID>"
		key_mgmt=NONE
	}
	```
